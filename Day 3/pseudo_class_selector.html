       <p>Prince Prithvi Narayan Shah's education began at the age of five through the appropriate ceremony[citation needed]. At that time, the responsibility to educate him was given to Mokchyeshwor Aryal and Bhanu Aryal, They were the Upadhyayas who worked in the palace as astrologers, where they were also known as Jyotish or Jaisi[citation needed]. Even though his primary education was provided by the Gurus, the duty of developing his character was taken by Queen Chandra Pravawati. It is said that seeing the prince of neighbouring states Tanahun, Lamjung, and Kaski being indulged in excess pleasure, Chandra Pravawati kept Prithvi Narayan Shah away from pleasurable and wrong pursuits. That is why no traces of pleasurable pursuits and diversion can be found in his early life.</p>
