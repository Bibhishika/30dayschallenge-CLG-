        <p>Situated just east of the Annapurna Base Camp trek, the Mardi Himal 
            trek is a hidden gem, as few trekkers make their way to Mardi Himalâ€™s Base Camp, 
            spectacularly situated at the base of Mardi Himal and the beautiful and imposing Machhapuchhre 
            or Fishtail. The trail winds along small paths through ancient rhododendron 
            forests, until you climb out at around 3,300m. Here, the landscape changes 
            quite abruptly with amazing views of Mardi Himal, Machhapuchhre, Annapurna 
            South and Hiunchuli. From High Camp (3,580m) you can climb in about 3-4 hours 
            to Mardi Himal Base Camp, which offers spectacular close up views of the entire 
            Annapurna Range. There is also an amazing viewpoint approx 2 hours from High Camp.
